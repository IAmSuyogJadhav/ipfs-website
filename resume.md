## Projects
`Dec. 2018-Ongoing`
__T. A. L. K. (The Aid for Language Kinetics)__ Currently working on this research project under the supervision of [Dr. J. Thangaraj](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jaisingh_Thangaraj). We are trying to design custom recurrent neural networks to use for detecting the whole American sign language (including the gestures) in a more practical and scalable way, using small and lightweight hardware sensors mounted on the arms of the user, instead of bulky cameras. Can be thought of as text-to-speech, but for sign language.

`Jan. 2019`
__[Brainy](https://github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/Brainy/)__ Along with 2 fellow members of the team, designed a web portal that can be used by doctors to get the brain MRI scans analyzed simply by uploading the scans using their login ID. We modified the U-Net model and trained it to segment out the brain tumors from the MRI scans of the brain. We achieved a dice coefficient of 0.43 (higher the better). The project got 4th rank out of a total of 22 finalist teams in the PanIIT AI Hackathon 2019.

`Oct. 2018`
__[WalkSafe](https://github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/WalkSafe)__ Along with Udbhav and Aniket (fellow members of the team), designed an application that alerts unaware pedestrians and those with hearing disabilities if a car is approaching them. We synthesized the dataset by randomly superposing car horn snippets on background noise. Trained an LSTM model and got ~85% accuracy on the validation set.

`Sept. 2018`
__DriveSmart (A startup funded by CIIE, IIT Dhanbad)__ Developed a smart system for cars that alerts the driver with visual cues and audio alerts when the driver gets distracted from the road or is drowsy. Used OpenCV, and dlib to create a multithreaded real-time object detector that could achieve object detection speeds of more than 60 FPS. Further, designed and trained a head pose estimation model in TensorFlow. Only the multithreaded object detector is open-sourced ([here](https://github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/Lightning-Fast-Object-Detector)) due to NDA.

`Jul. 2018`
__[FaceSearch](https://www.github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav/FaceSearch)__ Created a command-line tool that takes an image, detects faces in it, lets the user select one and then tries to establish the identity of the person by performing Google reverse Image search on the face. Used OpenCV. Implemented in Python. The project got 25 stars on the GitHub repository in a short time after its release.

The complete list of projects can be found on [my Github profile](https://github.com/IAmSuyogJadhav).

## Positions Held

`Dec. 2018 - Jan. 2019-`
__Python Developer Intern, DataProrrisi Inc__ Developed the backend in Flask for DataProrrisi, a startup focused on revolutionizing the loan acquisition process using machine learning, based in California.

`Dec. 2017 - Present`
__AI Team Member, Cyber Labs__ A core member of the AI team of Cyber Labs, the official cyber society of IIT (ISM), Dhanbad. Cyber Labs is the initiative of IIT (ISM) students on the footsteps of MIT Media Labs, MIT. Our team focuses on working on various projects that use ML, DL or in general, any field of AI.

## Recent Achievements

`Jan. 2019`
__3rd Runner Up @ PanIIT Mission AI: Solve For India__ Secured 4th rank in the final round out of 22 teams selected for the final round. We trained a model to segment brain tumors from 3D MRI data. We were able to achieve a weighted dice loss of around ~-0.43 on the validation set. The model was then served through a web app, designed by me using Flask. Previously, we had achieved 11th rank overall out of more than 300 teams in the qualifying round to qualify for the final round. The final round of the Mission AI: Solve for India hackathon organized by PanIIT, was held at IIT Delhi from 19th to 20th January 2019.
